<p>Mango Quartz also known as Golden Crown, or Corona Quartz is a very rare variety of Quartz that was recently discovered in the region of Boyaca, Columbia. It's crystal formations are needle-like, prismatic and double terminated.  This beautiful and unique crystal features Halloysite tubules inclusions that shoot through the terminations, rather than sitting as a coating on the surface, resulting in the phenomenal mango-like color.</p>

<p>The mineralization of this crystal occurred in a bed of Limestone that aged around 66-100.5 million years ago. The overall process of the Quartz forming took an estimated 33 million years.</p>

<p>A stone of good luck and good fortune, Mango Quartz can be used to promote abundance, creativity, adventure, prosperity, and generosity.</p>
