        <p>Smokey Quartz is commonly found in places like Brazil, Africa, Scotland, and the state of Colorado. It's actually the national gem of Scotland, with "Cairngorm" Quartz, from the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland, being particularly sought after.  Most Smoky Quartz ranges from light brown to grey in color, and some call Morion Quartz is very dark. </p>
            <p>Some say that it takes several million years for a quartz crystal to take on the deeper, dark smoky quartz color compared to the lighter smoky quartz color. Smoky quartz is photosensitive and if you allow it to remain directly exposed to sunlight it will change its color over time.</p>
            
            <p>These stones are used to alleviate physical pain especially in parts of the body where you carry a lot of tension.</p>
                <p>
            Many ancient religions believe that Smoky Quartz was solidified water or ice and with this connection to the water, it was used in ceremonies to create rain. In North America, ceremonial wands were tipped with smoky quartz and have been used in ancient Cherokee shamanistic rituals.</p> 
            <p>Smoky Quartz has been said to reduce electromagnetic stress. This type of stress builds up in the body from too much time spent without contact with nature, without contact specifically to a natural source that allows you to purge your body of the built-up electromagnetic stress, it absorbs the electromagnetic stress.</p>
